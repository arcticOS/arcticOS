TODO for version 0.2a
- Move ILI9341-specific code into hardware/screen.h file
    - Add graphics rendering
        * Should be very easy, just copy the font rendering but use a uint16_t for each pixel and allow variable sizes
- Finish keypad support
- Add flash storage support
    - Add persistent settings
    - Add notes app or smth
- Let EVT4 and EVT3 share code where possible
    - Cellular
        * Give them each their own #defines for where the UART is
    - Display
        * They should(?) have the same pinout, but do #defines anyway for whoever doesn't
