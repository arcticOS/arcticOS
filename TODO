TODO
    Core
        - More cohesive project structure
        - Clearly separate drivers
        
    UI
        Top Bar
            - Implement top bar in process_interface
            - Draw in top 16-24px? Apps can draw over if need be
        Recyclable Menu System
            - Come up with more solid design:
                - pre-made elements (buttons, list, etc...)
                - put all elements in linked list(maybe?)
                - scroll through elements with directional stick
                - when in these menus input is sent to the selected element
                - allow choosing whether or not to allow selecting the element (eg. select some labels for lists but not all)
