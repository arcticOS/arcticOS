+=============================+

Version 0.2-alpha:
    KERNEL
        GENERAL
            - Figure out how to do multitasking
            - Create syscalls for API
                - Global settings
            - Permissions
        STORAGE


    GRAPHICS
        GENERAL
            - Add bitmap rendering
                * Should be very easy, just copy the font rendering but use a uint16_t for each pixel and allow variable sizes
            - printf implementation for screen functions
            - Add more primitives
                - Round Rect
        UI

    APPLICATIONS
        - Add notes app or smth

        SETTINGS
            - Advanced Settings
                - Overclock/Underclock

    DRIVERS
        FLASH

        GPIO
            - Add PWM

        RTC
            - Figure out how to make RTC actually run

Version 0.3-alpha:
    * Needs new dev hardware b/c EVT3 has no support for most new features

    KERNEL
        GENERAL
            - Application Permissions
            - Memory Protection
            - Find some way to protect UART, SPI, etc...
        CRYPTOGRAPHY
            - SHA-256 hashing
            - AES-256 encryption
                - Have to find a way to securely store key

    DRIVERS
        FLASHLIGHT
            - Turn flashlight on/off with syscalls

            - Fire syscall when SMS comes in
            - Start call
            - End call
            - Fire syscall when call comes in
            - Get modem status
        KEYPAD
            - Joystick for navigation
            - Syscalls for navigation buttons
            - Special buttons
